# LDYOM
A mission-making platform for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Created as a spiritual successor of [DYOM](https://dyom.gtagames.nl/), it uses C++/Lua external plug-ins and technically is modular in contrast to DYOM's hardcoded features all done in its 'main.scm' script.
Making use of visual scripting with some basic programming and node systems, it allows designers to make non-linear missions (here referred as 'Scenes'/'Projects' starting from 0.8) and is overall very flexible and rich with a wide library of nodes covering a plethora of things, from camera settings and audio control to memory read/write functions, to logical operations.
