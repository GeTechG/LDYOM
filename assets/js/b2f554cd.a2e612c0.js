Finally, we\'ve reached a stage where the removed features have been reinstated, namely the Lua engine and node editor. Starting from the next version, I\'ll be focusing on polishing the release version for the new beta release. This means that a new version is coming soon; however, it doesn\'t mean that there won\'t be anything new. On the contrary, I\'m looking forward to your suggestions for the features you most need to be added to this version. Additionally, I\'ll be working on documentation and revising the website soon, and there might be some instructional videos.\\r\\n\\r\\nDownload new version: [Beta 0.8.0 Preview 9](https://github.com/GeTechG/LDYOM/releases/tag/Beta_0.8_preview_9)\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S.
