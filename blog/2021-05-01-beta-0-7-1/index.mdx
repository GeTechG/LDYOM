title: Beta 0.7.1
description: This version turned out to be, to put it mildly, late from the plan. I've already mentioned the reason, but I'll repeat it.
    I've been facing problems for a long time that I couldn't solve because they were related to moonloader, and its code is closed.
    I've posted on the forum many times, either getting no response or being told to look for the problem in my own code.
    And in the end, I decided to switch to C++, rewriting LDYOM on it, thus having almost all the code under my control, except for the GTA itself.
    Yes, I haven't gotten rid of all the unknown game crashes. But at least it's something.
